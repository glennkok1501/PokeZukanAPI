    "effect": "this pok\u00e9mon's moves completely ignore abilities that could hinder or prevent their effect on the target.  for example, this pok\u00e9mon's moves ignore abilities that would fully negate them, such as water absorb; abilities that would prevent any of their effects, such as clear body, shell armor, or sticky hold; and abilities that grant any general protective benefit, such as simple, snow cloak, or thick fat.  if an ability could either hinder or help this pok\u00e9mon's moves, e.g. dry skin or unaware, the ability is ignored either way.  abilities that do not fit this description, even if they could hinder moves in some other way, are not affected.  for example, cursed body only affects potential future uses of the move, while liquid ooze and shadow tag can only hinder a move's effect on the user.  this ablity cannot ignore type or form changes granted by abilities, for example color change or forecast; nor effects that were caused by abilities but are no longer tied to an ability, such as the rain from drizzle.  this ability cannot ignore multitype at all.  an ability ignored by this ability is only nullified while the move is being used.  for example, this pok\u00e9mon's moves can paralyze a pok\u00e9mon with limber, but limber will activate and heal the paralysis immediately thereafter, and this pok\u00e9mon's spikes are not affected by this ability after they have been placed.  when this pok\u00e9mon enters battle, all participating trainers are notified that it has this ability.  this ability functions identically to mold breaker and turboblaze.",
    "description": "moves can be used on the target regardless of its abilities."
